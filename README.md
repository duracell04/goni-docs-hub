## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use akalabs.io**

Simply visit the [akalabs.io Project](https://akalabs.io/projects/a61f2e65-6350-470d-9344-2a5f9e3c93c8) and start prompting.

Changes made via akalabs.io will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in akalabs.io.

The only requirement is having Node.js & pnpm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
pnpm install

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
pnpm dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.

## Loading Goni docs locally

The app pulls markdown straight from the `duracell04/goni` repository at runtime. If that repo is private (or you hit GitHub rate limits), set a `GONI_GITHUB_TOKEN` with `repo` scope in your environment before running `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, or `pnpm start`.
